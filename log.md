### Day 2: September 29, 2021)
##### A challenge from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) solved (Permuting two arrays)

**Today's Progress**: Solved two challenges on HackerRank. Sounting sort 1 and Pangram. I learn a lot about array methods and functional programming :)
**Thoughts: I have problems because I don't knew I need to put a function in to the sort() method to work correctly. But once I understood it, I was able to solve the exercise without further problems.
