# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 28, 2021)
##### two challenges from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) solved (counting sort and pangrams)

**Today's Progress**: Solved two challenges on HackerRank. Sounting sort 1 and Pangram. I learn a lot about array methods and functional programming :)

### Day 2: September 29, 2021)
##### A challenge from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) solved (Permuting two arrays)

**Today's Progress**: I soved permuting two arrays challenge. I learnt that the js array method sort need a callback function to work properly.
**Thoughts: I have problems because I don't knew I need to put a function in to the sort() method to work correctly. But once I understood it, I was able to solve the exercise without further problems.

### Day 3: September 30, 2021)
##### A challenge from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) solved (Subarray division)

**Today's Progress**: Solved subarray division challenge on HackerRank. I learnt that I need to undersand statement of the problem firts start coding.
**Thoughts: I have problems because I did not read the problem statement correctly and I had overthinking about another problem that not corresponds.

### Day 4: October 1, 2021)
##### First mock test from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) failed (Subarray division)

**Today's Progress**: I tried my first mock test from HackerRank but I can't solve it. I was ran out the time to reply.
**Thoughts: I can not find a way to solve the problem.

### Day 5: October 2, 2021)
##### Retry first mock test [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) solved (Subarray division)

**Today's Progress**: I find a solution after seeing a bit the discussion of the problem. I was able to solve the problem. It was not the most efficient approach but it works.
**Thoughts: I thought so much about it when it really was very simple.
