# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 28, 2021)
##### two challenges from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) solved (counting sort and pangrams)

**Today's Progress**: Solved two challenges on HackerRank. Sounting sort 1 and Pangram. I learn a lot about array methods and functional programming :)

### Day 2: September 29, 2021)
##### A challenge from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) solved (Permuting two arrays)

**Today's Progress**: I soved permuting two arrays challenge. I learnt that the js array method sort need a callback function to work properly.

**Thoughts:** I have problems because I don't knew I need to put a function in to the sort() method to work correctly. But once I understood it, I was able to solve the exercise without further problems.

### Day 3: September 30, 2021)
##### A challenge from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) solved (Subarray division)

**Today's Progress**: Solved subarray division challenge on HackerRank. I learnt that I need to undersand statement of the problem firts start coding.

**Thoughts:** I have problems because I did not read the problem statement correctly and I had overthinking about another problem that not corresponds.

### Day 4: October 1, 2021)
##### First mock test from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) failed (Flipping the matrix)

**Today's Progress**: I tried my first mock test from HackerRank but I can't solve it. I was ran out the time to reply.

**Thoughts:** I can not find a way to solve the problem.

### Day 5: October 2, 2021)
##### Retry first mock test [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) solved (Flipping the matrix)

**Today's Progress**: I find a solution after seeing a bit the discussion of the problem. I was able to solve the problem. It was not the most efficient approach but it works.

**Thoughts:** I thought so much about it when it really was very simple.

### Day 6: October 3, 2021)
##### No coding, just thinking about my portfolio

**Today's Progress**: I thought about my portfolio and sketch some ideas.

### Day 7: October 4, 2021)
##### Two challenges from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) solved (Sales by match and zig zag sequence)

**Today's Progress**: I solved two challenges: sales by match count the number of socks pairs in an inventary to be sold. Zig zag sequence, I had to modify a code wrote in C++ that permute an array to be ordered from max to minor from the midle of the array to the corners. Aditionaly I work on my portfolio page.

**Thoughts:** I had to use a few the try and error method to be able to solve the zig zag sequence problem.

### Day 8: October 5, 2021)
##### Three challenges from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) solved (Ceasar cipher, tower breakers and drawing book)

**Today's Progress**: I solved 3 challenges from hackerrank: Ceasar cipher is a method to cipher a message shifting the alphabet letters in a determinated number. drawing book let you see how many times do you need to move pages once by once to find a determinate page in the book. tower breaker is a game that consist in divide towers floors, the firts one that have not moves lose the game. The program let you know which player won betwen two players that always plays in the most efficient way.

**Thoughts:** I had problems because I did not consider all posible cases for these problems, but at once I considered them and with a bit of trie and error I was able to solve all the challenges :)

### Day 9: October 6, 2021)
##### a challenge from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) solved (MaxMin)

**Today's Progress**: I solved a challenge called MaxMin. Given a array arr and a integer k that is less than arr size. You have to find the subarray of length k which difference between its firts and last element is minimal and then return the value of the minimal value. 

**Thoughts:** I had problems because I tried to use an dictionary structure to find the minimal and it means too many steps to execute, and not a efficient aproach.

**Link to work:** [Max min unfairness](https://github.com/edwarhman/hackerrank-challenges/blob/main/max-min-unfairness.js)

### Day 10: October 7, 2021)
##### I started to code my personal portfolio

**Today's Progress**: I coded the navbar of my portfolio. I put some button options, style the bar and animate it.   

**Thoughts:** I did't know how to animate element very well, so I had to reseach how animation in CSS work.

**To do**: I have to make mi navbar responsive.

### Day 11: October 8, 2021)
##### I tried to do the Dynamic array challenge from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

**Today's Progress**: I tried to solve the challenge which given a matrix of intgers you have to create a new array dynamically and return the answers following the challenge specification.    

**Thoughts:** I I tried to create the new array not sufficient dynamic I think. So I was able to reach with a solution after seeing the discussion a bit.

### Day 12: October 9, 2021)
##### Two challenges from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) solved (Dynamic array and Char grid)

**Today's Progress**: I solved two challenges from HackerRank. The one that I couln't complete yesterday and the Char grid challenge that consist in the following: Given a grid of char elements so I need to sort ascending all its rows and then check if all the columms are sorted in ascending order. If they're so return "YES", else return "NO". I used split, map, forEach, charCodeAt to solve this problem.
